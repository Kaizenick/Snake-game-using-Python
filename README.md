# Snake-game-using-Python
In this project I have used curses to build a simple snake game in Python.</br>
The Python module is a fairly simple wrapper over the C functions provided by curses; if you’re already familiar with curses programming in C, it’s really easy to transfer that knowledge to Python. </br>
The biggest difference is that the Python interface makes things simpler by merging different C functions such as addstr(), mvaddstr(), and mvwaddstr() into a single addstr() method.<\br>
So in this project I have built a snake game. It is a good simple project to start with in python.
